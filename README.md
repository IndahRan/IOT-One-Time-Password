# IOT-One-Time-Password
This program generates a 6-digit OTP code, which will be sent to the user's email address. The OTP code is created using the [TOTP](https://github.com/lucadentella/TOTP-Arduino) library developed by lucadentella. The program continues to send a new OTP code each time there is an input in the form of "/start" in the Telegram bot, defined in the #define BOT_TOKEN section. Additionally, the program is integrated with [HiveMQ](https://www.hivemq.com/demos/websocket-client/), an MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) platform that can be implemented to support communication and data exchange in the Internet of Things (IoT). The data entered into MQTT is then displayed on the spreadsheet using [Node-Red](https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/).
